2. Deterrence

It sends a message — both to Darryl and others — that using extreme violence to intimidate or silence people, especially in connection with criminal activity, will bring severe consequences.

3. Protection of the community

Given the brutality of the attack and Darryl’s involvement in an ongoing criminal operation, a substantial period of incarceration helps ensure he cannot harm others or use violence to protect illegal activities.
