2. Deterrence

It sends a message — both to Darryl and others — that using extreme violence to intimidate or silence people, especially in connection with criminal activity, will bring severe consequences.

3. Protection of the community

Given the brutality of the attack and Darryl’s involvement in an ongoing criminal operation, a substantial period of incarceration helps ensure he cannot harm others or use violence to protect illegal activities.

Overall, the goal is not revenge, but public safety, accountability, and discouraging similar acts of violence in the future.",40,1,1,5,4,"I thought the study was clear and straightforward.

The behavior is pushed all the way to the harsher extreme of second-degree murder by that final deed.

 However, I'm choosing the top of that normal range rather than the statutory maximum of 50 years because the law permits a wide range and typical punishments fall between 20 and 30 years.","I want to use this sentence to protect the public from someone who has shown a willingness to escalate conflict into deadly action, hold Darryl entirely accountable for a horrific and intentional homicide, and discourage others from using retaliatory violence.  However, a 30-year sentence is still in line with standard court procedure, which contributes to the preservation of proportionality and justice in sentencing.",20,1,2,3,4,
