\caption{Hostile aggression (quantitative) plotted against prosocial language similarity (Sentence-BERT). Each point represents one participant, colored by punitiveness. The flat regression line ($r = -.04$, $p = .35$) demonstrates that hostile aggression is unrelated to prosocial language use: participants who score high on hostile aggression invoke deterrence, public safety, and rehabilitation just as readily as those who score low. This null relationship is the key evidence against the individual-level prosocial facade hypothesis and for the cultural default interpretation.}
