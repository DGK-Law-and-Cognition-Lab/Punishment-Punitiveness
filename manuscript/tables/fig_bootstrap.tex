\caption{Bootstrap distribution of the difference in correlations between hostile aggression and crime concerns with punitiveness ($\Delta r = r_{\text{Hostile}} - r_{\text{Crime}}$). The solid red line indicates the observed difference; dashed green lines indicate the 95\% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval (10,000 iterations). The entire distribution falls well above zero (dashed black line), confirming that hostile aggression is a substantially stronger correlate of punitiveness than crime concerns.}
