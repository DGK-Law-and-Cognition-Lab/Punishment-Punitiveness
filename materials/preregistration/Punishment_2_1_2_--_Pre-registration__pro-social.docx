**Authors**

This pre-registration is currently anonymous to enable blind
peer-review. It has 3 authors.

## **1) Have any data been collected for this study already?**

Yes, the current study mostly replicates a preliminary study,
(unpublished; preregistration #129382) whose results matched its
predictions very closely. Due to the undue length of the preliminary
study, we broke it into two separate studies, one of which we are now
preregistering. This version also includes minor changes to increase
conceptual clarity. Specific changes include:

-   We dropped several measures (all of secondary importance)

-   We added new measures to expand the potential theoretical
    contribution

-   We included three alternative vignettes to enhance generalizability
    of the sentencing decision

-   We removed pre/post vignette emotion and Righteousness measures as
    preliminary data showed no differences

-   We also removed a manipulation of the victim's race (Black v.
    White), as preliminary data showed no differences

Other than that, the current predictions are very similar to the ones we
originally preregistered, and we expect the results of this new study to
be very similar to both the predictions and findings made at that
preliminary phase.

## **2) What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?**

We seek to ascertain whether public punitiveness is positively
correlated with a variety of dependent measures (listed in section 3).
From a normative point of view, these factors should be correlated
negatively (or not at all) with punitiveness, especially in light of the
prosocial tenet that underlies the canonic justifications of criminal
punishment (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation,
norm expression). Positive relationships with punitiveness will call
into question the bedrock tenet of prosocial nature of criminal
punishment.

*Primary Hypotheses:*

**H1:** Punitiveness will be positively correlated with all listed
correlate measures.

**H2:** The \"Hostile Aggression\" cluster (hatred, revenge,
degradation, suffering, prison violence) will show stronger correlations
with punitiveness than the \"Crime Concerns\" cluster (perceived crime
rates, fear of crime).

**H3:** Most correlate measures will be positively intercorrelated,
suggesting a cohesive psychological "punitiveness mindset."

The punitiveness construct will be comprised of the following measures:

-   Belief in more punishment

-   The Benthamite principle of parsimony

-   Support for three strike laws

-   Support for life in prison without the possibility of parole

-   Support for the death penalty

-   A sentencing decision in a second-degree murder case

## **3a) Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured.**

*(R) = Reverse coded*

1.  The current level of punishment in the United States is too high (R)

2.  The solution to crime is more punishment

*Demographics:*

-   Age

-   Gender

-   Race/Ethnicity

-   Education level

-   Political orientation (liberal-conservative)

## **Open-Ended Measures**

Immediately following the sentencing decision, participants will be
asked:

\"In your own words, please explain why you recommended this sentence
for Darryl. What was your reasoning?\"

(Please write at least 2-3 sentences explaining your thinking.)

**Purpose:**

-   Capture spontaneous justifications for punishment decisions

-   Validate quantitative measures against qualitative reasoning

-   Identify which justifications (deterrence, retribution, revenge,
    incapacitation) are cognitively accessible

-   Provide illustrative quotes for manuscript

**Analysis Plan:**

*Dictionary-Based:*

-   Custom justification dictionaries (deterrence, revenge, retribution,
    incapacitation, rehabilitation word lists)

-   LIWC categories (anger, certainty, power, moral language)

-   Correlate dictionary counts with personality measures

*Sentiment & Emotion:*

-   Overall sentiment valence (VADER or RoBERTa-based)

-   Emotion detection (anger, disgust, fear) using NRCLex or GoEmotions

-   Target-specific sentiment toward defendant vs. victim

*Topic Modeling:*

-   LDA or BERTopic to discover emergent themes

-   Correlate topic loadings with sentence length and personality
    measures

*Semantic Similarity:*

-   Sentence embeddings (Sentence-BERT)

-   Compute similarity to justification prototype sentences

-   Cluster responses in semantic space; correlate clusters with
    psychological profiles

*Zero-Shot Classification:*

-   Classify justification type without training data (BART-large-mnli
    or similar)

-   Multi-label classification: deterrence, revenge, retribution,
    incapacitation, rehabilitation

*Moral Foundations:*

-   Score responses using extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (eMFD)

-   Test whether moral foundation profiles predict punitiveness
    correlates

*Validation Analyses:*

-   Consistency scoring: Do open-ended themes match quantitative scale
    scores?

-   Facade detection: Identify participants with prosocial language but
    high \"dark\" scale scores

-   Implicit bias: Flag coded racial language; correlate with Racial
    Resentment scores

## **4) How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?**

All participants will be in the same condition and see identical
materials. The only exception is that for the sentencing measure, each
participant will be randomly presented with one of three alternative
vignettes (intended to enhance generalizability):

*Vignette A: Stranger Felony-Murder*

Darryl Smith (recently unemployed) attempts purse-snatching in parking
lot. Victim resists, struggle ensues, Darryl strikes her, she falls over
railing and dies.

*Vignette B: Domestic Violence Murder*

Darryl Smith and Frankie Williams were dating. History of domestic
abuse, restraining order. Darryl violates order, confrontation, chase,
Frankie hit by traffic and dies.

*Vignette C: Organized Crime Murder*

Darryl Smith runs car theft operation. Frankie Williams is suspected
snitch. Darryl and accomplice ambush and beat Frankie, who dies from
injuries.

All three result in second-degree murder conviction.

## **5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.**

**5.1 Correlational Analyses** We will use Pearson correlations to test:

-   Punitiveness vs. each of 5 clusters

-   Punitiveness vs. each of \~\~18 constructs

-   Punitiveness vs. each of \~74 individual measures

-   Intercorrelations among all clusters and constructs

Results will be presented as heat maps with significance indicators.

**5.2 Vignette Standardization** Because the three vignettes may produce
different baseline sentence distributions, we will:

-   Z-score sentences within each vignette condition before computing
    correlations

-   This removes vignette-specific variance while preserving individual
    differences

**5.3 Sensitivity Analyses**

-   Mixed-effects models with vignette as random intercept to confirm
    correlations hold across conditions

-   Compare correlation patterns across the three vignettes

### *Hypotheses:*

**H1:** Punitiveness will be positively correlated with all listed
correlate measures.

**H2:** Hostile Aggression cluster will show stronger correlation with
punitiveness than Crime Concerns cluster.

-   *Test:* Compare r(Punitiveness, Hostile Aggression) vs.
    r(Punitiveness, Crime Concerns) using Steiger\'s Z-test for
    dependent correlations.

**H3:** Most correlate measures will be positively intercorrelated.

-   *Test:* Majority of off-diagonal correlations in construct-level
    matrix will be positive and significant.

## **6) Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations.**

n/a

## **7) How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined.**

480

## **8) Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)**

The following analyses are not confirmatory but will be conducted for
exploratory purposes:

*Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA):*

-   Run EFA on all correlate measures to examine empirical clustering

-   Compare emergent factor structure to theoretical 5-cluster framework

-   Identify potential redundancy or cross-loading items

*Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA):*

-   Test fit of theoretical 8-cluster model

-   Report CFI, RMSEA, SRMR fit indices

-   Compare theoretical model to EFA-derived model

*Descriptive Statistics*

-   Report % of participants above/below scale midpoints for each
    measure

-   Highlight prevalence of \"dark\" attitudes (hatred, racial
    resentment, etc.)

*Demographic Moderators*

-   Explore whether correlations differ by political orientation, race,
    gender, age

-   Not hypothesis-driven; for exploratory purposes only

*Qualitative Analysis*

-   Thematic coding of justification responses

-   Correlation between coded themes and quantitative measures

*Construct Reliability*

-   Will report Cronbach\'s alpha for all composite measures

-   Composites with α \< .60 will be interpreted with caution

*Multiple Comparisons*

-   Given large number of correlations, we will:

    -   Report exact p-values

    -   Apply FDR correction for construct-level analyses

    -   Focus interpretation on effect sizes rather than significance
        alone

*Open Data*

-   Full dataset will be made publicly available upon publication

-   All materials (survey, measures, analysis code) will be shared

*Deviations from Pre-Registration*

-   Any deviations will be transparently reported in the manuscript
