This pre-registration is currently anonymous to enable blind
peer-review. It has 3 authors.

**1) Have any data been collected for this study already?**

Yes, the current study is based largely on that preliminary study,
(unpublished; preregistration \# ???), whose results matched the
predictions very closely. For reasons of conceptual clarity and length,
we decided to break up that preliminary study into two separate studies,
one of which we are now about to conduct. In Addition to dropping many
measures, the current study also adds new measures and is designed more
tightly. The current predictions are very similar to the ones we
originally preregistered, and we expect the results of this new study to
be very similar to the findings that were both predicted and found in
that preliminary phase.

**2) What\'s the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in
this study?**

We seek to ascertain that public punitiveness is positively correlated
with numerous dependent measures (listed in section 3) which, from a
normative point of view, should be correlated negatively (or not at
all).

All factors will be correlated with the punitiveness construct -- which
will be comprised of the following judgments and beliefs \--

-   Belief in more punishment

-   The Benthamite principle of parsimony --R

-   Support for three strike laws

-   Support for life in prison without the possibility of parole

-   Support for the death penalty

-   A sentencing decision in a second degree murder case

**3.a) Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will
be measured.**

The correlates include \--

1\. Perceived crime rates

2\. Fear of crime

3\. Essentialization of criminal behavior

4\. Crime is a choice

5\. Permissibility of Due Process violations

6\. Permissibility of uncertain evidence of guilt

[Emotions towards criminals]{.underline}

7\. hatred of criminals

8\. Anger towards criminals

[Harshness towards criminals]{.underline}

9\. Social exclusion of criminals

10\. Degradation of criminals

11\. Infliction of suffering as a goal of punishment

12\. Acceptability of prison violence

13\. Support for harsh prison conditions

14\. Belief in Revenge as a goal of punishment

[Personality Measures]{.underline}

15\. Right Wing Authoritarianism

16\. Social Dominance Orientation

17\. Vengeance as a personal trait

18\. Violence proneness

19 Racial Resentment

20\. TV sport viewership of blood sports (UFC, boxing, hunting,
wrestling)

**4) How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?**

All participants will be in the same condition and see the identical
materials. The only exception will be that each participant will see one
of three alternative vignettes as part of the sentencing measure
(intended to enhance generalizability)

**5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main
question/hypothesis.**

We will use linear regression to rest the following hypotheses:

-   The focal DV is punitiveness will be positively related almost all
    of the listed measures

-   Most measures will be positively related to one another

**6) Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your
precise rule(s) for excluding observations.**

**7) How many observations will be collected or what will determine
sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly
how the number will be determined.**

**8) Anything else you would like to pre-register?** (e.g., secondary
analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses
planned?)
