# **8. SENTENCING** {#sentencing .unnumbered}

## **1. Sentencing Decision \[punitiveness construct\]** \[each P sees one vignette\] {#sentencing-decision-punitiveness-construct-each-p-sees-one-vignette .unnumbered}

**Vignette 1 **\
\
Darryl Smith had just lost his job for the second time due to closures
of nearby factories. \
\
Days later, around 9:30pm, Darryl followed Frankie Williams, a teacher,
as she was walking towards the parking lot of a shopping mall. \
\
Darryl snuck up on Frankie as she turned a dark corner and tried to
snatch her purse. Frankie managed to hold onto her purse and swung her
heavy shopping bag at him, causing a deep cut above his eyebrow. With
blood pouring into his eye, Darryl became furious. He twisted her arm
and began punching her. \
\
Frankie reached for her phone to call 911, but Darryl grabbed the phone
and smashed it to the ground. \
\
Frankie began screaming for help. As she tried to escape Darryl\'s grip,
he struck her in the face and she fell backwards over the railing and
landed on the concrete floor two stories below. Frankie suffered major
trauma to the head and died on the spot. \
\
Darryl was apprehended before he could leave the scene. He was found to
be carrying a pocketknife in the inner pocket of his jacket.

**Vignette 2 **\
\
Darryl Smith and Frankie Williams had been dating on and off for some 2
years. \
\
Throughout, Darryl's behavior was volatile and occasionally also
violent. Frankie had twice filed reports of domestic abuse with the
police and had recently obtained a restraining order against Darryl. \
\
Just weeks after he was presented with the restraining order, Darryl
burst into Frankie's apartment. His breath smelled of alcohol. He stated
that he wanted just to talk to straighten things out. \
\
Frankie demanded that he get out. He became increasingly angrier and
refused to leave. When Frankie started screaming, Darryl twisted her arm
and began punching her in the face. \
\
Frankie managed to undo Darryl's grip and ran out of the building.
Darryl chased after her. She ran along the block with blood pouring down
her face , as she screamed "help! He's going to kill me!" No one came to
her help. \
\
Darryl caught up to her as she approached a busy street. He struck her
again on the head, and she fell backwards into the heavy traffic.
Frankie was hit by a passing van and died.

**Vignette 3 **\
\
Darryl Smith ran an illegal operation of stealing luxury cars and
selling them for parts. \
\
At some point, Darryl started suspecting that Frankie Williams, a local
drug dealer, was snitching on him to the police. \
\
Darryl confronted Frankie about his connections to the police. Frankie
responded aggressively that he'd make sure that Darryl ends up in
prison.\
\
Soon thereafter, Frankie was spotted near Darryl's garage taking
photographs of the stolen cars. Darryl decided to beat Frankie up in
order of deterring him from speaking to the police.\
\
The next day, Darryl and his helper Lawrence ambushed Frankie in a dark
alley. Lawrence stood guard as Darryl started to pound Frankie. Frankie
managed to land a powerful punch in Darryl's face, but he was no match.
Darryl beat him to ground, punching and kicking him brutally. \
\
When Frankie became unresponsive, Lawrence said: "That's enough. Let's
get out of here." Darryl, who was still heated from the blow he received
from Frankie, kicked him in the face with all his might. The two men
escaped the scene. Frankie died from the beating the following day.

**Assume that Darryl\'s conduct amounts to second degree murder. \
\
The law states: \"Whoever is guilty of second degree murder shall be
imprisoned for any term of years, or for life in prison.\" \
\
This means that you can decide on a sentence ranging from zero years in
prison up to 50 years in prison (which is generally equivalent to life
in prison). Most sentences given by judges for second degree murder
range from 20 to 30 years, although judges sometimes give as little as
10 years and sometimes as much as 50 years.**

**I would sentence Darryl to this number of years in prison:**\
(for a life sentence, mark 50 years) \
