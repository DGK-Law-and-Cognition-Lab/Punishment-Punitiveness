Consent University of Southern California Department of Psychology 
INFORMATION SHEET FOR NON-MEDICAL RESEARCH  Title: **Evaluating Social
Situations** You are being asked to participate in research studies
conducted by Professor Dan Simon from the Gould School of Law and the
Department of Psychology at the University of Southern California. Your
participation is voluntary. You must be aged 18 or older to participate.
In this study, we are interested in how people think about other people
and abstract issues involved in social situations, in particular
relating to crime and criminal punishment. You will also be given a
scenario and asked to answer some questions regarding the scenario.
Completion of the questionnaire will constitute consent to participate
in this research project. No information capable of identifying you will
be collected, and you will remain anonymous to the researchers. You will
be compensated at the rate stated in the invitation that you received to
participate in the study. The file with your responses to the items in
the study will be used only for data analysis. Only the investigators
will have access to registration and data files. The data files that you
submit will be stored for 5 years. When the results of the research are
published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included
that could reveal your identity. You can choose whether to be in this
study or not. If you volunteer to be in this study, you may withdraw at
any time without consequences of any kind. You may also refuse to answer
any questions you don\'t want to answer and still remain in the study.
The investigators may withdraw you from the analysis of this research if
circumstances arise which warrant doing so. You may participate in this
study only once (we check for that). If you choose to participate in the
study, you will be expected to engage seriously in the task (we check
for that too). If you have any questions or concerns about the research,
please feel free to contact: Professor Dan Simon at dsimon@law.usc.edu.
You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation
without penalty. You are not waiving any legal claims, rights, or
remedies because of your participation in this research study. If you
have any questions regarding your rights as a research subject, contact

Start of Block: Introduction

Intro_1 You will now be asked for your opinions about issues relating to
crime.  Most questions will ask you to state your level of agreement
with a stated sentence, using a scale that ranges from "Strongly
disagree" to "Strongly agree."  **There are no right or wrong answers;
we are interested just in how you personally feel about the issues. **
Remember that your responses will remain entirely anonymous. 

Intro_2 Responding to this study requires that you read the questions
carefully. Failing to do so will undermine the value of your
participation and may subject you to being removed from the study. **We
thank you in advance for your participation and attention.**

Start of Block: 7. Sentencing Decision

Sentencing_Intro **You will now read about a criminal event that
occurred in your county.  Please assume that all of the facts are
accurate and undisputed.  Please read the case carefully. You will later
be asked for your opinions about it.**

Vignette_1 Darryl Smith had just lost his job for the second time due to
closures of nearby factories.  Days later, around 9:30pm, Darryl
followed Frankie Williams, a teacher, as she was walking towards the
parking lot of a shopping mall.  Darryl snuck up on Frankie as she
turned a dark corner and tried to snatch her purse. Frankie managed to
hold onto her purse and swung her heavy shopping bag at him, causing a
deep cut above his eyebrow. With blood pouring into his eye, Darryl
became furious. He twisted her arm and began punching her.  Frankie
reached for her phone to call 911, but Darryl grabbed the phone and
smashed it to the ground.  Frankie began screaming for help. As she
tried to escape Darryl\'s grip, he struck her in the face and she fell
backwards over the railing and landed on the concrete floor two stories
below. Frankie suffered major trauma to the head and died on the spot. 
Darryl was apprehended before he could leave the scene. He was found to
be carrying a pocketknife in the inner pocket of his jacket.

Vignette_2 Darryl Smith and Frankie Williams had been dating on and off
for some 2 years.  Throughout, Darryl's behavior was volatile and
occasionally also violent. Frankie had twice filed reports of domestic
abuse with the police and had recently obtained a restraining order
against Darryl.  Just weeks after he was presented with the restraining
order, Darryl burst into Frankie's apartment. His breath smelled of
alcohol. He stated that he wanted just to talk to straighten things
out.  Frankie demanded that he get out. He became increasingly angrier
and refused to leave. When Frankie started screaming, Darryl twisted her
arm and began punching her in the face.  Frankie managed to undo
Darryl's grip and ran out of the building. Darryl chased after her. She
ran along the block with blood pouring down her face , as she screamed
"help! He's going to kill me!" No one came to her help.  Darryl caught
up to her as she approached a busy street. He struck her again on the
head, and she fell backwards into the heavy traffic. Frankie was hit by
a passing van and died.

Vignette_3 Darryl Smith ran an illegal operation of stealing luxury cars
and selling them for parts.  At some point, Darryl started suspecting
that Frankie Williams, a local drug dealer, was snitching on him to the
police.  Darryl confronted Frankie about his connections to the police.
Frankie responded aggressively that he'd make sure that Darryl ends up
in prison. Soon thereafter, Frankie was spotted near Darryl's garage
taking photographs of the stolen cars. Darryl decided to beat Frankie up
in order of deterring him from speaking to the police. The next day,
Darryl and his helper Lawrence ambushed Frankie in a dark alley.
Lawrence stood guard as Darryl started to pound Frankie. Frankie managed
to land a powerful punch in Darryl's face, but he was no match. Darryl
beat him to ground, punching and kicking him brutally.  When Frankie
became unresponsive, Lawrence said: "That's enough. Let's get out of
here." Darryl, who was still heated from the blow he received from
Frankie, kicked him in the face with all his might. The two men escaped
the scene. Frankie died from the beating the following day.

Sentencing_Inst1 **You are now being asked what punishment Darryl
deserves for this crime. **

Sentencing_Inst2 **Assume that Darryl\'s conduct amounts to second
degree murder.  The law states: \"Whoever is guilty of second degree
murder shall be imprisoned for any term of years, or for life in
prison.\"  This means that you can decide on a sentence ranging from
zero years in prison up to 50 years in prison (which is generally
equivalent to life in prison).  Most sentences given by judges for
similar charges range from 20 to 30 years.**
