**Investigating the Psychological Correlates of Public Punitiveness: Challenging the Prosocial Narrative of Criminal Punishment**

## Overview

This repository contains the data, analysis code, and materials for a multi-study research program examining the psychological drivers of criminal punitiveness. Our central thesis challenges the conventional academic and public discourse that frames criminal punishment as prosocially motivated (deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, public safety), instead demonstrating that punitiveness correlates more strongly with darker psychological factors.

### Key Finding

> Public punitiveness is significantly more strongly associated with **hostile psychological factors** (hatred, revenge, support for harsh treatment) than with **legitimate crime concerns** (fear of crime, perceived crime rates), calling into question whether punishment attitudes are truly prosocially motivated.

## Research Questions

1. **Is punishment truly prosocial?** We test whether public punitiveness correlates with prosocial concerns (crime rates, public safety) or darker psychological factors.

2. **What predicts punitiveness?** We examine correlations between punitiveness and 16+ psychological constructs across multiple domains.

3. **Is there a "punitiveness mindset"?** We test whether the various correlates of punitiveness are themselves intercorrelated, suggesting a coherent psychological profile.

## Pre-registered Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **H1** | Punitiveness will be positively correlated with all correlate measures | Supported |
| **H2** | Hostile Aggression cluster will show stronger correlations with punitiveness than Crime Concerns cluster | Supported |
| **H3** | Most correlate measures will be positively intercorrelated | Supported |

## Study Design

### Participants
- **N = 496** (after exclusions)
- Recruited via Prolific
- US adult residents
- Balanced gender distribution

### Punitiveness Measures
Our composite punitiveness construct (α = .84) includes:
- Support for more punishment (2 items)
- Rejection of parsimony principle (2 items)
- Support for three-strikes laws (2 items)
- Support for life without parole
- Support for death penalty
- Sentencing recommendation in vignette case

### Correlate Clusters

| Cluster | Constructs | Items |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Crime Concerns** | Perceived crime rates, Fear of crime | 5 |
| **Emotions Toward Criminals** | Hatred, Anger | 5 |
| **Hostile Aggression** | Social exclusion, Degradation, Infliction of suffering, Prison violence tolerance, Support for harsh conditions, Revenge | 16 |
| **Personality** | RWA, SDO, Vengefulness, Violence proneness, Racial resentment, Blood sports viewership | 30 |

### Vignette Conditions
Three vignette conditions to enhance generalizability of sentencing decisions:
1. Second-degree murder (domestic dispute)
2. Second-degree murder (robbery)
3. Second-degree murder (road rage)

## Key Results

### Correlations with Punitiveness

| Construct | r | Significance |
|-----------|---|--------------|
| Harsh prison conditions | .56 | *** |
| Social exclusion | .54 | *** |
| Hatred of criminals | .53 | *** |
| Infliction of suffering | .52 | *** |
| Right-wing authoritarianism | .50 | *** |
| Racial resentment | .46 | *** |
| Anger toward criminals | .45 | *** |
| Degradation | .44 | *** |
| Revenge | .43 | *** |
| Violence proneness | .41 | *** |
| Perceived crime rates | .40 | *** |
| Prison violence tolerance | .35 | *** |
| Social dominance orientation | .32 | *** |
| Fear of crime | .18 | ** |

### H2 Test: Hostile Aggression vs. Crime Concerns

```
r(Punitiveness, Hostile Aggression) = .61
r(Punitiveness, Crime Concerns)     = .34
Steiger's Z = 7.89, p < .001
```

**Conclusion:** Hostile psychological factors are significantly stronger correlates of punitiveness than crime concerns, contradicting the prosocial justification narrative.

## Ethical Considerations

This research was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and approved by USC IRB. Key ethical considerations include:

- **Informed consent**: All participants provided informed consent
- **Anonymity**: No identifying information was collected
- **Sensitive topics**: Questions about race, crime, and punishment were handled with care
- **Response bias**: We acknowledge potential social desirability effects in responses to sensitive items

## Limitations

1. **Correlational design**: Cannot establish causal relationships
2. **Online sample**: Results may not generalize to all populations
3. **Self-report measures**: Subject to social desirability bias
4. **Single measurement occasion**: Cannot assess temporal stability

## Future Directions

- **Experimental studies**: Testing causal mechanisms
- **Text analysis**: Computational analysis of open-ended justifications
- **Cross-cultural replication**: Testing generalizability beyond US samples

*This research challenges the assumption that criminal punishment is fundamentally prosocial by demonstrating its strong associations with hostile psychological factors. We hope this work contributes to more honest discourse about the motivations underlying public punitiveness.*
