# Contributing to PunishmentPunitiveness

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project! This document provides guidelines for contributions.

## Open Science Philosophy

This project is committed to open science principles. We welcome:

- **Replication attempts**: Independent verification of our findings
- **Re-analysis**: Alternative analytical approaches using our data
- **Extensions**: New hypotheses tested using our data
- **Bug reports**: Issues with code or data

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find an error in the code or data:

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/DGK-Law-and-Cognition-Lab/PunishmentPunitiveness/issues) to see if it's already reported
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Your R session info (`sessionInfo()`)

### Suggesting Improvements

For suggestions or questions:

1. Open an issue with the `enhancement` label
2. Describe your proposed improvement
3. Explain why it would be valuable

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Code optimization
- Additional analyses (must be clearly labeled as non-pre-registered)

#### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all code runs without errors
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Re-Analysis Guidelines

If you wish to conduct alternative analyses:

1. **Pre-register your approach**: We encourage pre-registration of new analyses
2. **Document deviations**: Clearly state any deviations from original methods
3. **Cite appropriately**: Credit the original data collection
4. **Share findings**: Consider opening an issue to discuss results
