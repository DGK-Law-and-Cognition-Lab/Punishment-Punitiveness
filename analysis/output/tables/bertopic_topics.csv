1,212,1_the_to_and_darryl,"['the', 'to', 'and', 'darryl', 'of', 'he', 'that', 'for', 'sentence', 'is']","['i recommended this sentence for darryl because of what he did regarding kicking frankie in the face as this led to his death. darryl needed to be held accountable for the murder of frankie from the beating that he gave him. this 30 year sentence is meant to serve as an example to others who might commit this same kind of crime. darryl needed to be held accountable and this was the right way to do this even considering the victim was a known drug dealer. this 30-year sentence imposed on the guilty party, darry smith, is mean to accomplish the thought that this kind of crime will not be tolerated and there are stiff punishments for these kinds of illegal actions. citizens like darryl need to be held accountable for these brutal actions and this is the best way to hold this type of criminal accountable so that they will not do this again in society. this sentence seemed more than appropriate for this kind of heinous crime committed by darryl to frankie williams.', 'i chose a sentence in the typical range for second-degree murder because the crime was extremely serious and resulted in the loss of a life, but i also want the punishment to remain proportional. darryl planned the assault and escalated it beyond what was intended, and the final blow delivered after frankie was already unresponsive shows a high level of responsibility. at the same time, i do not believe that a life sentence or the harshest possible punishment is necessary to achieve accountability. a 25-year sentence reflects the severity of the offense while allowing the possibility of rehabilitation. i hope the sentence will hold darryl accountable, protect the community, and give him the opportunity to reflect and change over time. the sentence should affirm the seriousness of taking another persons life without resorting to excessive punishment. it should communicate that violence has real consequences, while still leaving room for rehabilitation, personal growth, and eventual reintegration into society.', 'i would sentence darryl smith to 30 years in prison. this sentence reflects the seriousness of his actions, which escalated from an attempted robbery to a violent assault that resulted in frankie williamss death. although the crime was not premeditated, darryl continued to use force even after frankie resisted, destroyed her phone to stop her from seeking help, and engaged in conduct that showed reckless disregard for her life. a 30-year sentence falls within the typical range for similar second-degree murder cases and appropriately balances the need for accountability with the fact that the crime was not planned in advance. i hope this sentence will protect the public by incapacitating someone who displayed dangerous, escalating violence, while also holding darryl fully accountable for causing a loss of life. the sentence is intended to deter others from engaging in similar violent behavior and to reinforce the seriousness of such actions. additionally, the substantial prison term provides time for darryl to participate in rehabilitation programs that may help address the factors contributing to his behavior, offering a chance for personal change while still ensuring justice for the victim and community.']"
2,22,2_he_frankie_to_and,"['he', 'frankie', 'to', 'and', 'the', 'for', 'him', 'was', 'it', 'this']","['i think that he did not intend to kill frankie when he hit her, but he still needs to serve time for this crime. i really want to believe that this crime was intended to be a robbery, and it just went horribly wrong. giving the family some relief and justice for their victim, franklie, and i think the perpetrator will serve the amount of time they deserve for this crime.', 'what he did was brutal and completely over the line. he didnt just beat frankie he kept going even when frankie was already down. its clear he meant to hurt him badly and it ended in death. even if frankie had been annoying or threatening that doesnt justify killing someone. i hope the sentence shows that violent retaliation isnt okay, even for criminals. it also keeps him off the streets so he cant hurt anyone else and serves as a warning that actions like this have serious consequences.', 'it does not state it was his intention to murder frankie, so i did not go for life. but, he went to question frankie about his possibly lawful action against his own unlawful action. then he planned to beat him and didnt withdraw from the plan. then he beat him to the ground. then when it looked like frankie was already unconscious no more lesson to be taught and he is in serious condition to lawrence knowledge, he delivers one final blow to the facehead. perhaps lawrence did not care if frankiedied at the least and wanted him to die at the worst. teach lawrence that the law is just even to him, take away the freedom from lawrence to live his life as he wished that frankie may have enjoyed. it is likely more than half his life. yet he knows the law gave him a sentence to finish his sentence. he will likely never get out.']"
