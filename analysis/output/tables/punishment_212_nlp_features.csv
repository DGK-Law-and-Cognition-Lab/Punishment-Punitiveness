For example, I don't think that someone who shoplifts or commits another nonviolent crime should be considered on an equal plane with a serial killer or human trafficker. Some of the questions had implications that didn't allow me to choose a black-and-white answer on the scale, so I would choose Neutral on the scale for most of those.

It was interesting to stretch my brain in a different way.

Darryl disobeyed this, burst into Frankie's apartment and when she tried to call for help he began assaulting her, he then chased her, assaulted her again and she was killed for his lack of self control and basic human respect all people deserve. Even if Frankie got away, there would be a future Frankie for Darryl because he has self control issues and believes the laws that govern humanity and our society does not apply to him. ","It will keep a violent criminal out of society. Even if Darryl was single for a period, he would continue to become violent with others. ",39,2,4,4,5,"I would have not called the woman in the scenario Frankie, I would called it a more common female name to make things quicker. I had to go back and re-read the scenario twice to make sure I knew who was the man and who was the woman once it included a her pronoun. I just assumed at the beginning it was a gay relationship, which can be fitting as domestic violence in same sex relationships is higher than that of heterosexual couples.

The attack was planned, carried out with help, and continued long after Frankie was unconscious and after Lawrence said to stop. The last kick, which was given after the threat had passed, demonstrates a degree of fury and brutality that surpasses what is usually found in second-degree murder cases.

Darryl may not have meant to kill Frankie, but it was obvious that he wanted to cause great harm, and his actions were so careless that it was inevitable that Frankie would die. Because of this, I think a sentence that is just a little bit longer than the typical 20–30 year range is appropriate","Deterrence: Prolonged penalties may deter people from resorting to violence to settle disputes or intimidate potential informants.

i'm not a criminal, and have never preyed upon another; and even i am aware that actual Death is more-than-possible, when you ""engage"" with another human, like he had

darryl is lucky Death is not on the table


if darryl had preyed upon another man, his size (and perceived capability) or larger / stronger, and more economically-robust, then i would have extended him a little more leniency — maybe a 25 year sentence, instead","´just to keep a punk ass bitch off the street — honestly

i don't hope to ""reform"" darryl — i just want to keep a dangerous predator away from society

darryl might only be the smallest of fry, especially when compared to the C-Suite Dæmons who were the ones who caused darryl's second to fall through, in the first place; all the same, ""men"" who can't deal with their problems more constructively, *and* act predatorily, no matter how downtrodden, don't deserve my sympathy


the only ""message"" i am interested in sending, is ""there are consequences for your actions""",43,1,2,3,4,"you were asking a whole lot of questions, regarding Penalties and Criminality, etc.

a lot of questions, whose answers can, indeed, be taken out of context

unfortunately (for, perhaps, both, you *and* me), given that i am only being paid $2.75, for the contents of what's already in the questionnaire, i don't feel compelled to explain my own answers, here

typically, no one ever pays me for my Extended Thoughts, no matter how insightful

if you want my insights, you're gonna have to cough up some dough

For example, my 7 year old cousin was raped and murdered by a serial killer. He is currently in prison for life but he keeps trying to appeal and get out. This situation has heavily impacted my thoughts and beliefs about criminals and punishment. A lot of crimes don't compare to what that serial killer did to my cousin which is why I think that other crimes should have less time. I also believe that criminals should do rehabilitation methods while in jail (similar to the Norwegian prison system).",3,146,,,,2,6,3,5,3,5,4,3,6,1,1,1,1,1,3,5,2,3,3,-1.95188311976796,1.5,4.5,1.0,2.875,-0.927226656864749,-1.43955488831636,7.0,6.66666666666667,6.8,3.66666666666667,6.0,4.6,4.66666666666667,4.0,2.5,4.5,1.66666666666667,5.33333333333333,3.8125,1.0,1.0,3.8,1.25,2.5,1.0,1.7,2.66666666666667,2.25,2.42857142857143,Liberal,10 years is a long time! people tend to underestimate how much shorter sentences would help in the long run.,i'm hoping that 10 years will give him time to think about his actions and feel sad about what he did.,10 years is a long time! people tend to underestimate how much shorter sentences would help in the long run. i'm hoping that 10 years will give him time to think about his actions and feel sad about what he did.,20,21,41,0.094,0.727,0.179,0.2481,0.124,0.763,0.112,-0.0772,0.11,0.745,0.145,0.1759,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.7993995547294617,0.6571966409683228,0.6062567234039307,0.8718013763427734,0.3040240705013275,0.4564628005027771,0.8645017743110657,0.014613728038966656,0.6453704312443733,0.43955775117501616,0.20581268006935716,0.47055715,0.40017036,0.435208,0.5263965,0.50588405,0.53079534,0.35161525,0.458083,0.4627649,-0.0046818852,11.711433,2.974293,0,0,0.06999878873642473

1. Accountability for taking a life

A long sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime and the fact that Darryl’s deliberate, continued violence directly caused someone’s death.

2. Deterrence

It sends a message — both to Darryl and others — that using extreme violence to intimidate or silence people, especially in connection with criminal activity, will bring severe consequences.

3. Protection of the community

Given the brutality of the attack and Darryl’s involvement in an ongoing criminal operation, a substantial period of incarceration helps ensure he cannot harm others or use violence to protect illegal activities.

Darryl has a violent past, there have been prior incidences and this is exactly the type of person Darryl is. A violent, piece of trash criminal that should never see the light of day. I personally would prefer the death penalty as Darryl does not deserve to be supported by taxpayer money for the rest of his disgusting life.",That Darryl can never hurt another person again. This scum is not going to change no matter what is done. Certain people like Darryl are just born animals with no impulse control. They cannot be fixed or rehabilitated.

The United States is too soft. That is why people commit crimes daily and there are so many repeat offenders.
